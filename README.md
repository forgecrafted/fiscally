Projects with a financial or business bent often have to deal with awareness of a fiscal year, which typically doesn't line up with a normal calendar year.

The `Fiscally` gem adds the necessary awareness to your date and time objects, covering start and end dates for fiscal years and quarterly breakdowns.

## Installation

Gemfile
```
gem 'fiscally'
```

Command line
```
gem install 'fiscally'
```

### Ruby Version

Built and tested against **`2.0.0` and above**, but "probably works"&trade; in `1.9.3`.

## Usage

All calculations are done **relative to the date and/or time represented by your object**. This is particularly important to remember for methods that calculate a "current" value. Our documentation examples use dates in the past to drive this point home.

Time is always set to midnight (`00:00:00`), when applicable.

Examples below use `Time`, but all methods outlined are available to `Date` and `DateTime` objects as well.

### `#fiscal_start=`
###### `objekt.fiscal_start = 8`

Sets the **month** in which the fiscal calendar will start on the given `objekt`, represented as an `Integer`. The **day** is always set to the first of the month, and is immutable. Defaults to January (`fiscal_start = 1`).

This is the lynchpin of the entire system, adjusting the calendar start and end months to something other than January and December.

Calling `objekt.fiscal_start` without an assignment will return the currently set value.

This value is not frozen, and can be changed at any time.

```ruby
foo = Time.new(2014, 1)
foo.fiscal_start
# => 1

bar = Date.new(2015, 9)
bar.fiscal_start
# => 1

baz = DateTime.new(2025, 9)
baz.fiscal_start
# => 1

# this is mutable
baz.fiscal_start = 4
baz.fiscal_start
# => 4
```

### `#fiscal_quarter`

Returns an integer representing the current quarter.

```ruby
jan01 = Time.new(2015, 1)
jan01.fiscal_quarter
# => 1

jan01.fiscal_start = 4
jan01.fiscal_quarter
# => 4

jan01.fiscal_start = 10
jan01.fiscal_quarter
# => 2
```

### `#all_quarter_months`

Returns an array of arrays, the first level representing the quarters in order, followed by an array of integers representing the months within that quarter.

```ruby
jan01 = Time.new(2015, 1)
jan01.all_quarter_months
# => [[1,2,3], [4,5,6], [7,8,9], [10,11,12]]

jan01.fiscal_start = 4
jan01.all_quarter_months
# => [[4,5,6], [7,8,9], [10,11,12], [1,2,3]]

jan01.fiscal_start = 11
jan01.all_quarter_months
# => [[11,12,1], [2,3,4], [5,6,7], [8,9,10]]
```

### `#fiscal_quarter_months`

jan01.fiscal_start = 2
jan01.fiscal_quarter_months
# => [11,12,1]

jan01.fiscal_start = 11
jan01.fiscal_quarter_months

jan01.fiscal_start = 9
jan01.fiscal_quarter_months
# => [12,1,2]
```

### `#first_month_of_quarter`

jan01.first_month_of_quarter
# => 11

jan01.fiscal_start = 11
jan01.first_month_of_quarter
# => 11

jan01.fiscal_start = 9
jan01.first_month_of_quarter
# => 12
```

### `#first_quarter`

Returns an array of integers, representing the months of the first quarter. Aliased to `q1`.

```ruby
jan01 = Time.new(2015, 1)

jan01.fiscal_start = 12
jan01.beginning_of_fiscal_year.strftime('%F')
# => '2014-12-01'
